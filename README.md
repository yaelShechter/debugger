# debugger

Starting a personal project in my free time.
This is going to be a debugger, written in C++ and will be used for linux debugging. 
This is a preliminary version.

How to use (for now):
- Compile debugger
- Compile the program you want to debug
- In shell write: 
```shell
./debugger <name_of_program>
```
